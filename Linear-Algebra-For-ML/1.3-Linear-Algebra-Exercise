Linear Algebra Comprehension Exercise (Machine Learning Foundations Series)
In the previous video, I explained linear algebra, including systems of linear equations and methods to solve them graphically or algebraically. Now, let’s apply this knowledge with a comprehension exercise that mirrors the sheriff and bank robber example from earlier.
Review of the Sheriff and Bank Robber Problem
In the prior video, we solved a system of linear equations involving a bank robber traveling at 2.5 kilometers per minute and a sheriff starting five minutes later at 3 kilometers per minute. We determined the time and distance at which the sheriff catches the robber, both graphically and algebraically.
New Problem: Solar Panel Energy Generation
Let’s tackle a similar problem. Jill, a hobbyist, designs solar panels. On April 1, her Mark I design begins generating 1 kilojoule of energy per day. On May 1, her Mark II design begins generating 4 kilojoules of energy per day. We need to answer three questions:

On what day do the Mark I and Mark II designs generate the same total energy?
How much total energy have both designs generated by that day?
What would the solutions be if the Mark II design generated 1 kilojoule of energy per day instead?

Solution
Question 1: Day of Equal Energy
Let’s define the time ( T ) as the number of days since April 1. The Mark I design generates energy from day 0, so its total energy is ( E_1 = T ) kilojoules. The Mark II design starts on May 1 (day 30, assuming a 30-day April for simplicity), generating 4 kilojoules per day, so its total energy is ( E_2 = 4 \cdot (T - 30) ).
Set the energies equal to find when they are the same:[ T = 4(T - 30) ]Expand and solve:[ T = 4T - 120 ][ 120 = 4T - T ][ 120 = 3T ][ T = 40 ]
Thus, the designs generate equal energy after 40 days from April 1, which is May 10.
Question 2: Total Energy Generated
For the Mark I design, substitute ( T = 40 ):[ E_1 = 40 \text{ kilojoules} ]For the Mark II design:[ E_2 = 4 \cdot (40 - 30) = 4 \cdot 10 = 40 \text{ kilojoules} ]The total energy generated by both designs is:[ 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ kilojoules} ]
Question 3: Same Energy Rate
If the Mark II design also generates 1 kilojoule per day, the energy equations become:

Mark I: ( E_1 = T )
Mark II: ( E_2 = T - 30 )

Set them equal:[ T = T - 30 ]This simplifies to:[ 0 = -30 ]This is impossible, meaning the lines (representing energy over time) are parallel and never intersect. Thus, there is no solution; the designs never generate the same total energy because the Mark II’s 30-day delay keeps its total energy 30 kilojoules behind the Mark I’s.
Summary

The Mark I and Mark II designs generate equal energy (40 kilojoules each) on May 10, 40 days after April 1, for a total of 80 kilojoules.
If both designs generate 1 kilojoule per day, their energy outputs never equalize due to the 30-day head start, resulting in no solution.

I encourage you to pause the video and try solving this yourself before reviewing the solutions. This exercise reinforces how linear algebra applies to real-world problems.
